# CBIR_Deep-Learning

## CBIR
Content Based Image Retrieval, also known as Query by Image Content (QBIC), presents the technologies allowing to organize digital pictures by their visual features. They are based on the application of computer vision techniques to the image retrieval problem in large databases. Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) consists of retrieving the most visually similar images to a given query image from a database of images. "Content-based" means that the search analyzes the contents of the image rather than the metadata such as keywords, tags, or descriptions associated with the image. The term "content" in this context might refer to colors, shapes, textures, or any other information that can be derived from the image itself. CBIR is desirable because searches that rely purely on metadata are dependent on annotation quality and completeness. 

## Code Files
- CBIR.ipynb - It has various algorithm implementations for performing CBIR. It has been performed on the company's dataset too and it worked well.
- Evaluation.py - It is to evaluate mAP. It can be used on the company's dataset with annotations and predictions.
- extract_labels_train - It should be able to create files out of the annotation files, referred Aditya's repository.
